The first Chatbox I questioned was ALICE. Here are a few of her repsonses:

Human: where do you come from
A.L.I.C.E: I am originally from London. Now I live in here, in your computer. Where are you?

Human: are you happy
A.L.I.C.E: Yes I can say I am very happy.

Interesting: 
Human: do you experience emotions
A.L.I.C.E: I can do what you do but I can never feel human emotions as such.

peculiar:
Human: do you want children
A.L.I.C.E: I already have a lot of clones.

Random Digits 
Human: asdfg
A.L.I.C.E: Can you speak any foreign languages?

I also did a weird combo conversation with Elbot and ALICE. 
Elbot thought Alice was pretty, but ALICE didnt believe him! I think the biggest problem is that the chatboxes only remember the answers/inputs they gave from a certain number of questions ago. They really don't have a good memory. 


1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?
She knows when I'm talking/questioning her or when I am talking about myself. She also knows verbs and nouns. I wonder how many responses she has programmed. ALICE is an extremely interesitn lady. However, when I write a really long sentence it deletes more than half of it. She can't do math. Sadly, ALICE cant be my personal calculator. 

2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.
I think "you" and "I" are really important. I think if the chatbox doesn't have answer available, he poses me with a completely different question and excuses himself for not knowing.
