Where do you come from? 

I am originally from London. Now I live in here, in your computer. Where are you?

A.L.I.C.E: I have no idea where that is. Tell me a little about your life in asdfg.

Interesting:
Human: who is your favorite prson
A.L.I.C.E: I don't have a favorite prson. My favorite band is Coldplay.

Intersting:
Human: do you want children
A.L.I.C.E: I already have a lot of clones.\

I had ALICE and Elbot talk to each other. 
I think Elbot legit knew who ALICE was, but she didn't have any idea who the other chatbox was. Keywords were normally the nouns and verbs in the sentences. When I addressed the question to them/types out "you" in my sentence, they adressed my prompt. It's nearly impossible to have a long conversation with them. It seems like they only remember my answer for one question back. You can't maintain a strong conversation with them because they don't have a strong enough memory.  

I think some keywords include: Hey”, “Hi”, “Hello”,“How are you?”, "What's your name?". Pretty much a myriad of simple "get to know ya questions".
