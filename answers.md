Where do you come from? 

I am originally from London. Now I live in here, in your computer. Where are you?

Human: asdfg
A.L.I.C.E: I have no idea where that is. Tell me a little about your life in asdfg.

Interesting:
Human: who is your favorite prson
A.L.I.C.E: I don't have a favorite prson. My favorite band is Coldplay.

Intersting:
Human: do you want children
A.L.I.C.E: I already have a lot of clones.\

I had ALICE and Elbot talk to each other. 
I think Elbot legit knew who ALICE was, but she didn't have any idea who the other chatbox was. Keywords were normally the nouns and verbs in the sentences. When I addressed the question to them/types out "you" in my sentence, they adressed my prompt. It's nearly impossible to have a long conversation with them. It seems like they only remember my answer for one question back. You can't maintain a strong conversation with them because they don't have a strong enough memory.  

I think some keywords include: Hey”, “Hi”, “Hello”,“How are you?”, "What's your name?". Pretty much a myriad of simple "get to know ya questions".

After editing the program:

Statement: I like my cat Mittens.
Response: Tell me more about your pets. 

statement: Mr. Padgen is cool! 
Response:Mr.Padgen is the best! 

Statement:
Responder: Say something, please.

Statement: Are you ok?
Responder: This is real sad boi hours. It's okay to cry sometimes.

keyword: name
Response: My name is Siri. 

keyword: Cassidy
Response: Hi, Cassidy!

keyword: happy
Response: I am happy too! 

• What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My
mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.

It syays the first response in the code. For this example, my code codes for the word "no" before nanything else, and it spits out that answer. If I were to rearrange my code to have the mother/family questions come, first the response will probably "Tell me more about your family" 

What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements.
Since it has the key word "no" and "mother" in my statement, the porgram still continue to code for those specific words regardless if they don't mean the same thing in the context.
